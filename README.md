# DiaScrew

I wasn't happy with the diashow apps available in the world wide web, so I said: "Screw it, I am making my own."
Here we are now.

## Why NOT to use this

Display your pictures with better things than diashows. Come on, ain't 1999 anymore.

## Why to use this

If someone forces you, you live in the past or like vintage.

## For real

Basic python app to display images with boring transition and optional titles.

## Dependencies

Alongside Pillow this needs the tkinter package.

## Controls

You can press "F11" to switch to fullscreen.
Left and right arrow keys allow faster transfer to the next or previous slide.
